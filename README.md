## Rancher Terraform templates

### Purpose

These templates are for building and configuring Rancher management and compute stacks. They make heavy use of `cloud-config` and Rancher OS.

Currently, the modules are specific to AWS, but laid out such that other cloud providers could be added.

These are being used by Rancher Labs, and will be updated as we learn more.

### Usage

See rancher-*-demo accounts for the various types of environments.
